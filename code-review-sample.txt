Code review and rewrite src/main/scala/com/incremental_spark_loader/hive/HiveWriter.scala: 1/2 | len(iterative_code)=1040, len(self.i_context.code_doc.content)=1040
## Code Review: src/main/scala/com/incremental_spark_loader/hive/HiveWriter.scala
1. The code is mostly implemented as per the requirements. However, it assumes the existence of a `getOrElse` method on `config.targetTable`, which is not a standard Scala option handling. To achieve this correctly, we should use the standard Scala Option handling mechanism.
2. The code logic is correct in terms of functionality but can be improved for error handling and configurability of SaveMode.
3. The existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" but lacks explicit handling for the case when `targetTable` is not specified in the `Config`.
4. All functions mentioned in the task list are implemented in this file.
5. All necessary pre-dependencies for this file's functionality appear to be imported. However, it's not clear if `Config` class has the `targetTable` as an Option type or not. If not, this needs to be addressed.
6. Methods from other files, such as `Logger.log`, are being reused correctly.

## Actions
1. Modify the handling of `config.targetTable` to properly use Scala's Option type. This ensures the code is more robust and idiomatic. For example:
   ```scala
   val targetTable = config.targetTable match {
     case Some(table) => table
     case None => "default_table"
   }
   ```
2. Enhance error handling by wrapping the write operation in a more comprehensive try-catch block that can handle specific exceptions related to Hive and Spark SQL operations.
3. Make the `SaveMode` configurable through the `Config` class. This allows for more flexible data writing operations, such as overwriting existing data or appending to it based on runtime configuration.
   - Add a `saveMode` option in `Config.scala`.
   - Use this `saveMode` in `HiveWriter.scala` to set the save mode dynamically.
4. Ensure the `Config` class properly defines `targetTable` as an Option[String] to enforce the handling of cases where the target table is not specified.
